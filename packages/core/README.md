# @syncular/core

Core protocol types, schemas, and shared utilities for Syncular (scopes, commit-log types, telemetry, blob types, etc.).

Most apps won't depend on this directly. It is the shared foundation used by `@syncular/client`, `@syncular/server`, and the transports.

## Install

```bash
npm install @syncular/core
```
