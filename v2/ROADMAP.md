# v2 ROADMAP — after feature-done

Successor to REVISE.md (the v1→v2 rebuild plan, completed 2026-07-03) and
TODO.md (the road to feature-done, completed the same day — every buildable
item landed; see git history for the landing notes). The v2 skeleton plus
the full parity ladder is built, conformance-locked across both cores, and
benchmarked. This file plans what comes NEXT.

Standing rules, unchanged: spec-first (behavior lands in SPEC.md with
vectors or conformance scenarios before/with code), judgment calls get
codified back into the spec, no fallback paths (one good path per concern,
support floors not degradation ladders), and every landing keeps `bun run
check`, `bench:ci`, cargo, and the Rust conformance pairing green. Vendor
bytes don't gate size; syncular's own JS does (66 KB raw ceiling, re-derive
on legitimate growth).

## 1. Native bindings block (the one real parity gap)

The Rust core, the C-ABI FFI (`syncular-ffi`), and the shared command
router (`syncular-command`, conformance-locked via the shim) all exist.
This block is assembly on a proven core — packages, not protocol.

- [x] **Tauri** (decided 2026-07-03; landed 2026-07-04 —
      `tauri-plugin-syncular` in v2/bindings/tauri/plugin, its own cargo
      workspace, plus `@syncular-v2/tauri` in v2/packages/tauri; see
      v2/bindings/tauri/README.md): native syncular instance + React
      bridge — NOT JS syncular in the webview (webview OPFS is
      eviction-prone and inconsistent across WKWebView/webkitgtk; the Rust
      core gives a real file DB and native perf). Shape:
      `tauri-plugin-syncular` (Rust, consumes the client crate DIRECTLY —
      no FFI — exposing the `syncular-command` router as Tauri commands +
      invalidate/presence/sync-needed/conflict over Tauri events) plus
      `@syncular-v2/tauri` (JS bridge implementing the same
      `SyncClientLike` interface the react package already normalizes —
      hooks work unchanged, the fourth host of one interface after direct/
      worker/follower). Example upgraded to React (2026-07-04 —
      `example/src/frontend` is now a `@syncular-v2/react` hooks todo list over
      `createTauriSyncClient`, bundled with a dependency-light `Bun.build`; the
      only Tauri-specific line is the client construction). Caveat to document:
      every useSyncQuery run is one IPC round trip — fine at Tauri IPC latency;
      pagination guidance for huge result sets is a docs note.
- [x] **Swift + Kotlin wrappers** (landed 2026-07-04 — `bindings/swift`
      (SwiftPM `SyncularClient`) and `bindings/kotlin` (Kotlin/JVM
      `SyncularClient` via **FFM**, `java.lang.foreign`, JDK 21+ — zero JNI C
      glue; JNA documented as the JDK<21 fallback)): idiomatic thin wrappers
      over the FFI command surface — `command` + typed conveniences
      (mutate/subscribe/sync/query/readRows/presence/…) + a background
      `poll_event` loop delivering events (Swift → main-queue closure/delegate,
      Kotlin → listener). Lifecycle owned in the wrappers: `pause()`/`resume()`
      (stop-poll + disconnectRealtime / reconnect + restart) and a
      close-joins-the-poll-thread guarantee. Packaging: local dev via linker
      paths to the built dylib; release via `Syncular.xcframework` (Xcode) /
      AAR+jniLibs via cargo-ndk — all detected+skipped by build-native.sh.
      Each gets its own isolated `check.sh` running an OFFLINE HERMETIC smoke
      (no server: mutate → readRows shows the optimistic row; `sync()` reports
      `transport.unavailable` on the lean core). Swift runs green on this mac
      (10/10, Swift Testing on CLT); Kotlin compiles+tests in CI on Ubuntu
      (JDK 21) — its check.sh detect-and-skips a JDK-less mac. Reused v1's
      packaging KNOWLEDGE only, never its code. Todo demos added
      (`bindings/{swift,kotlin}/example`): a Swift SwiftUI-window + terminal app
      (window presents on CLT-only, no Xcode) and a Kotlin terminal app, each
      driving the wrapper end-to-end against the quickstart server — proven by a
      real native-transport sync with an independent client reading the row back
      (Swift verified locally, Kotlin via a CI example smoke).
- [x] **React Native** (landed 2026-07-04 — `@syncular-v2/react-native` under
      `bindings/react-native`): a TurboModule over the FFI, surfacing the SAME
      `SyncClientLike` JS interface so `@syncular-v2/react` works unchanged in
      RN (RN uses the NATIVE core — Hermes has no OPFS/sqlite-wasm). Ships the
      package correctly structured: `createNativeSyncClient()` (SyncClientLike
      over a NativeModule, `{$bytes:hex}` + command JSON, mirroring the Tauri
      bridge), the codegen-ready `.ts` TurboModule spec, iOS (ObjC++ shim over
      the C ABI + RCTEventEmitter) + Android (Kotlin FFM shim, zero JNI C glue +
      DeviceEventManager) native sources, and podspec/build.gradle. Honest
      scoping: verified via JS-bridge tests with an injected NativeModule double
      (11/11 bun: SyncClientLike parity vs `normalizeClient`, bytes, events,
      lifecycle) + `tsc`; the native shims' manual verification recipe is
      documented. A bare-RN **example todo app** (`bindings/react-native/example`)
      now lands the hooks over the native client — its real `App.tsx` is rendered
      headless against a NativeModule double (2 more bun tests, 13/13 total) as
      the hooks↔module integration proof, with the device build a documented
      one-time overlay + an Android CI lane sketched as a follow-up.
      NitroModules/JSI is the follow-up for latency; the C ABI is the stable
      substrate.
- [x] **Native transport §8.7 completion** (landed 2026-07-04): the
      native-transport feature now runs rounds **over the socket** in the
      one-loop shape (§8.7), not `POST /sync`. Request goes out `0x01`-tagged;
      the reader thread demuxes by channel tag, reassembling the `0x01`
      response stream to `END` via a new Rust `MessageStreamScanner`
      (`ssp2`, mirroring the TS reference with the exhaustive split-point
      tests) while queuing `0x00` deltas to the inbound lane. One round in
      flight enforced client-side; mid-round drop fails the round; no socket
      → `POST /sync` (the not-connected rule, not a fallback pair). The
      transport-agnostic tag demux + reassembly is `syncular_client::
      RealtimeRound`, shared by the FFI and Tauri native transports (which
      stay byte-for-byte parallel). Proven by the FFI `round_tests` — a
      scripted in-test `tungstenite` server speaking §8.7 bytes built with
      the `ssp2` codec (round-trip, byte-chunked reassembly, delta-during-
      round queuing, mid-round-drop). Also fixed a latent WS handshake bug in
      both native `realtime_connect`s (hand-built request omitted the
      mandatory upgrade headers). The env-gated native-transport *conformance
      lane* was assessed and **declined** as contortions: the native
      transport is encapsulated in the ffi crate (not the shim's deps), and
      the harness's whole design inverts transport to the host — a native
      lane needs a second driver mode + a real per-instance bun server, not a
      small flag. The scripted Rust-local tests prove the §8.7 loop against
      real WebSocket traffic directly instead.
- [x] **Flutter + Dart binding + todo demo** (landed 2026-07-04 —
      `bindings/flutter/syncular` (Dart package) + `bindings/flutter/example`
      (a ~150-line single-file Flutter todo app); see
      `bindings/flutter/README.md`): the last platform with no binding. A
      `dart:ffi` wrapper over the five C functions (hand-written FFI
      typedefs from `rust/ffi.h` — no ffigen), a `SyncularClient` mirroring the
      Swift/Kotlin surface exactly (command + the typed conveniences
      mutate/subscribe/sync/syncUntilIdle/readRows/query/pendingCommitIds/
      conflicts/presence/setPresence/setWindow/windowState/… + connect/
      disconnectRealtime), a `poll_event` loop delivered to a broadcast
      `Stream` (a `Timer.periodic` doing NON-BLOCKING `timeout_ms=0` polls on
      the owning isolate — the honest simple choice for a callback-free FFI, no
      background isolate, never races a command, `close()` cancels the timer
      synchronously), and pause/resume/close. Dylib loading: `DynamicLibrary.
      open` per-platform names + a `libraryPath`/`SYNCULAR_LIBRARY_PATH`
      override (the Kotlin/Swift pattern). The example todo app lists via
      `query`, adds/toggles via `mutate`, auto-syncs on the `sync-needed` event
      + a manual sync button, connecting to the `apps/demo` server (8787).
      Offline-first hermetic tests (`dart test`) mirror the Swift/Kotlin suite
      (mutate → optimistic `version -1` row, query, outbox, `transport.
      unavailable`, close idempotence, pause/resume). Its own `check.sh`
      detect-and-skips a Dart-less machine (SKIPS locally on this mac — no
      dart/flutter installed). CI lane (`flutter-bindings`, Ubuntu,
      path-gated): `cargo build -p syncular-ffi` → `subosito/flutter-action` →
      `dart analyze` + `dart test` with `SYNCULAR_LIBRARY_PATH` at the built
      `.so` — the `dart:ffi` boundary against the REAL Rust core is the strong
      proof; the app BUILD is a documented local `flutter run` (`flutter build
      web` is N/A for `dart:ffi`; `flutter build linux` needs GTK deps — the
      Tauri/RN honest-scoping precedent). Example platform scaffolds are
      `flutter create`-generated and git-ignored; the app code is the
      deliverable.
- [x] **Native schema codegen: Swift/Kotlin/Dart emitters + all demos
      generated with `--check` freshness** (landed 2026-07-04): `@syncular-v2/
      typegen` gained three IR-driven emitters (`src/emit-{swift,kotlin,dart}.
      ts`), opt-in per manifest via `output.{swift,kotlin,dart}` (path string or
      an options object — Kotlin `package`/`objectName`, Swift `enumName`;
      additive within `output`, no `manifestVersion` bump). Each file carries
      the TS emitter's DO-NOT-EDIT + `irHash` header, is gated byte-exactly by
      `generate --check`, and has a determinism golden in the typegen suite
      (`test/golden-native.test.ts`, rides `bun run check`). Honest type mapping
      (integer→Int/Long/int, bytes+crdt→[UInt8]/ByteArray/List<int>, blob_ref/
      json→String; `fromRow` accepts SQLite 0/1 as booleans) documented in the
      typegen README §5. Every demo now consumes REAL generation: Swift + Kotlin
      speak a generated `notes` schema (`SyncularSchema.schema` + typed `Notes`
      rows + subscription helpers replacing the hand-built literals), Flutter a
      generated `todos` schema, and the Tauri + RN examples ship REAL typegen
      output from their own manifests (mirroring `apps/demo-react`) in place of
      the hand-written stand-ins. Each binding `check.sh` runs `generate
      --check` as a freshness gate (bun-gated, so it runs even where the
      platform toolchain is absent). No new CI jobs — the goldens ride the main
      bun gate, the freshness gates ride the existing per-binding jobs.
- [ ] **Native CRDT editing (yrs)**: optional — the server merges, so
      native apps already converge; yrs integration is only needed for
      local collaborative EDITING UX on native. Demand-gated within this
      block.
- [x] **Conformance for bindings** (decided + landed 2026-07-04; doctrine in
      `bindings/README.md`): the stdio shim locks the CORE (the shared
      `syncular-command` router, 68/68), and every binding consumes that SAME
      router — so wrappers are protocol-thin and re-running the catalog per
      wrapper would test the router N more times and marshaling zero more.
      The thin bar: each wrapper ships an OFFLINE HERMETIC smoke against the
      REAL native core (Swift `swift test`, Kotlin `gradle test`) + a parity
      proof where it feeds JS hooks (RN + Tauri bridges accepted by the React
      `normalizeClient`, driving every `SyncClientLike` member — a drift breaks
      the suite). Anything that grows logic beyond marshaling graduates to its
      own pairing lane; today none does.

## 2. Deployment completion

- [x] **Durable Object realtime for Workers** (landed 2026-07-03):
      `SyncularRealtimeHost`/`SyncularRealtimeDO` in server-workers — one DO
      per partition hosting the RealtimeHub, WS hibernation driving the
      existing RealtimeSession (rehydrated from a minimal socket attachment +
      the D1 client record on wake), in-DO commit fan-out, D1 storage; the
      `/realtime` upgrade route + the HTTP-push wake path (the in-platform
      LISTEN/NOTIFY analogue). Hermetic tests drive the real session/hub/D1
      code through the real DO class over a DO double (d1-double doctrine) +
      the reference codec — the conformance bar for a deployment adapter.
      Real-`wrangler dev` smoke is a documented manual recipe, not an
      automated lane: `wrangler` bundles workerd/esbuild/miniflare (>100 MB)
      — disproportionate for one WS round when the double exercises the real
      logic (README "Real-workerd smoke"). Closes the last "supported now
      (HTTP)" asterisk in the deployment matrix.
- [x] **Blobs on Postgres** (landed 2026-07-04): the optional blob storage
      methods (`setBlobRefs`, `listRowsReferencingBlob`,
      `listReferencedBlobIds`) on PostgresServerStorage, plus the
      `sync_blob_refs` table + `(partition, blob_id)` covering index in
      `POSTGRES_DDL` (parity with the SQLite dialect; `migrate()` stays
      idempotent, all `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`). The shared `ServerStorage`
      contract's new blob section runs on pglite alongside sqlite/D1, and
      `postgres-explain.test.ts` asserts the by-blob candidate scan is
      index-driven (no `Seq Scan`). A Workers/PG deployment now supports
      blobs end-to-end (push writes refs in-commit; the download handler
      authorizes via the reference index).
- [x] **S3 segment stats** (landed 2026-07-04): `S3SegmentStore.stats()`
      via a LIST-free pointer-object accumulator (fixed key, read-modify-
      write on `put`, ETag `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` CAS retry loop; a HEAD
      dedups idempotent re-puts). Counters are honestly **approximate** —
      surfaced as an additive `approximate: true` marker on
      `SegmentStoreStats`/`BlobStoreStats` that flows through
      `admin.segmentStats()`/`stats()`; the exact in-process stores omit it.
      The s3-stub gained conditional-write (ETag) support. Blob bytes ride
      the in-process stores (no S3 blob store class yet), so there is no S3
      `blobStats()` path today — documented, and the accumulator pattern is
      ready for it. Tests: stub round-trip, idempotent-re-put dedup,
      deterministic CAS-reject (no-lost-update) simulation, admin marker
      carry-through.

## 3. Windowed sync W1 (the differentiator)

Design is DONE (`DESIGN-eviction.md`, 2026-07-03): windows = scope-value
sets; window-scoped subscriptions (window change = sub-set diff, add =
fresh image bootstrap, remove = unsubscribe fused with eviction); zero
wire changes, zero server changes; sequenced AFTER the WS-native loop
(done) as required.

- [x] **W1 implementation** (landed 2026-07-04): window registry in both
      clients (`_syncular_windows` + a `_syncular_window_pending_evict`
      deferred-eviction table), `setWindow(base, units)` / `windowState(base)`
      on the TS `SyncClient` (mirrored on the worker handle + follower
      forwarding, one interface) and the Rust core (+ `syncular-command`
      router commands, so the shim/Tauri/RN bridges reach it unchanged),
      eviction fused with unsubscribe (E1 outbox-pin defers, E2 version dies
      with the row, drained on the next push), re-entry via the image lane,
      Appendix B.18's six conformance scenarios (74/74 both pairings, fresh
      shim), the SPEC edits §8 enumerates (§3.3 eviction note, §4.1
      omission-as-unsubscribe, new §4.8, §8.1 timing note — the §4.7 phasing
      resolution was already landed), the query-completeness oracle
      (`windowState` + the `useWindow` React hook, I3), and a cheap bench
      value-sharding proof (`{A,B}→{B,C}` re-downloads only C — asserted as a
      correctness budget in `bench:ci`). Own-JS budget re-derived 66 → 72 KB
      (the shipped differentiator, +6.1 KB raw / +1.65 KB gzip).
- [ ] **W2 TTL sugar** (codegen creation-time bucket columns) — after W1
      proves out.

## 4. DX polish

- [x] **Kysely typed local queries** (landed 2026-07-04): `@syncular-v2/
      kysely` — a Kysely `SyncularDialect` (reusing Kysely's SQLite compiler/
      adapter/introspector) whose driver runs SELECTs over a host's
      `query(sql, params)` surface, so it works on ALL hosts (direct/worker/
      follower/Tauri/RN), not just the direct client — it never touches
      `ClientDatabase`. READ-ONLY by contract: the driver rejects any
      non-SELECT (and transactions) loudly, pointing at `mutate()` (writes
      MUST go through the outbox, §7.1). Its OWN package (not a web-client
      subpath), so Kysely never enters the core bundle — bundle-entry reaches
      nothing here; own-JS stays 69.10 KB (72 KB ceiling untouched). Typegen
      emits a `Database` interface (table→Row map) additively — all embedded
      generated files regenerated (fixture, demo, quickstart, both create-app
      templates; --check byte-exact). React: `@syncular-v2/react/typed`'s
      `useTypedQuery(qb => …)` compiles the builder, extracts `{tables}` from
      the compiled AST (exact invalidation, no text heuristic), and reuses
      `useSyncQuery`'s machinery — behind a subpath with kysely as OPTIONAL
      peers so plain `useSyncQuery` apps never pull Kysely. Also: the worker
      host now schedules an autoSync round after `mutate`/`setWindow` so local
      writes and window widenings push/bootstrap promptly under `autoSync`
      (the host loop owns rounds, §8.4).
- [x] **Named queries — the cross-platform type-safe query tier** (landed
      2026-07-04): the sqlc/SQLDelight rung, decided with Benjamin as the
      cross-platform type-safe query answer (over per-runtime ORMs that want to
      own the connection, and over a custom cross-runtime DSL that would be a
      per-language maintenance trap). A `.sql` file in `queries/` (one file =
      one query, kebab→camel) transpiles into a typed function on every
      platform — TS/Swift/Kotlin/Dart — killing query↔type drift by
      construction. SELECT-only (the read tier; writes stay `mutate()`),
      rejected loudly otherwise. Type-checked **by SQLite itself**: typegen
      synthesizes the schema DDL from the IR, builds an in-memory bun:sqlite
      DB, and `prepare()`s each query — SQLite validates every reference and
      yields column decltypes. Plain column refs get the EXACT IR type +
      nullability (resolved against the IR); computed expressions fall back to
      a documented honest type (bun:sqlite exposes decltype + paramsCount but
      no origin/param-names/NOT-NULL — the fidelity boundary is documented).
      `:name` params: types inferred from column comparisons, or a
      `-- param :name <type>` header override. Each query bakes in its exact
      FROM/JOIN table set for invalidation. Emitted per-language into its OWN
      file (`*.queries.*`) so schema-only consumers never churn; `--check`
      byte-exact per language. React: `useNamedQuery(query, params)` reuses
      `useSyncQuery`'s machinery with the query's exact `{tables}`. Kysely
      stays the TS dynamic tier; raw `query()` stays the escape hatch —
      the three-tier read story. Dogfooded: demo-react's list read + the
      Swift/Kotlin example TodoStores converted to named queries (demo-react
      keeps a `useTypedQuery` aggregate so the dynamic tier stays visible;
      Swift gate green — generated queries compile in the example).
- [ ] **Named-query layout redesign — scale to hundreds of queries** (DESIGNED
      2026-07-04, awaiting Benjamin's confirm before build). The v1 layout above
      is flat (one dir, one query per file, one giant generated file, flat global
      names) and does NOT scale. New model DECIDED with Benjamin: **file-per-.sql
      output** (each `.sql` → its own generated file); **namespace defaults from
      the folder path, name from the filename**; **override both via a name
      directive** — a comment whose whole body is a dotted identifier path
      (`-- a.b.theFunction` → namespace `a.b`, name `theFunction`, ABSOLUTE
      override); **multiple queries per file**, each opened by its name directive
      (the directive doubles as the query delimiter). Namespace is a REAL
      language construct (nested object/enum/package), not just an import path.
      OPEN CONFIRMS before build: (1) directive grammar = "comment body is a
      dotted ident path" — so a bare `-- list` is a directive, not prose (vs. a
      marker prefix like `-- @ …`); (2) dotted directive replaces the folder
      namespace (absolute) — confirmed intent, pending final ok; (3) output
      location — co-located next to the `.sql` vs. a per-language mirrored output
      root (orchestrator leans mirrored-root for the multi-target repos; demos
      emit ≥4 languages from one manifest). Supersedes the flat model; demos
      migrate. No wire/runtime impact — generate-time only.
- [ ] **Per-rowid invalidation refinement**: today's granularity is
      table + scope-key (honest to the wire); a table→rowid dependency
      option for hot single-row views was left room for in the design.
      Demand-gated.
- [ ] **Stabilize timing-sensitive test flakes under load** (PARTIAL 2026-07-04,
      commit fe09e277 — NOT resolved): the agent fixed a real production bug and
      the react act() warnings, but the full-suite flake PERSISTS (~1-in-6, on
      EITHER multi-tab test; passes 10/10 in isolation). Root cause is a
      cross-file interaction in bun's shared-process test run (process-global
      BroadcastChannel + leader-lock state + event-loop pressure), NOT the logic
      fixed below — the agent's "20/20 under load" measured CPU starvation, the
      wrong trigger. REMAINING FIX (open): process-isolate the global-primitive
      tests (multi-tab, maybe realtime) into their own bun run, or find the
      specific cross-file global-state leak. Do before the publishing pipeline
      makes CI the merge authority. What DID land:
      - *React suite (test-race)*: `integration.test.tsx` + `parity.test.tsx`
        fired `client.mutate(...)` OUTSIDE `act()`, so the invalidation →
        re-query → `setState` chain it drives landed as floating microtasks
        the assertion raced (that IS the act()-warning the suite emitted).
        Fix: wrap the mutate/`syncUntilIdle` calls in `await act(async …)` so
        React flushes those updates deterministically. The act() warnings are
        gone. Sibling sweep: the three I4/presence negative-assertion
        `setTimeout(r, 5)` "give a stray effect a tick to not fire" sleeps in
        `hooks.test.tsx` were replaced with a deterministic `act`-microtask
        flush (`flushEffects`) — no wall-clock ticks left in the react suite.
      - *Multi-tab fanout (PRODUCTION-race, upgraded from flake to bug fix)*:
        `bootFollower` handed back a follower handle whose `FollowerLink` had
        not yet processed the leader's `announce` (epoch −1). `FollowerLink`
        drops any `event` whose epoch ≠ its own with NO retry, so any
        invalidation the leader fanned out in the hello→announce window was
        silently lost — a real miss a just-opened multi-tab follower could hit,
        not merely a test artifact (proven deterministically:
        an epoch-3 event delivered to an unbound follower is dropped).
        Fix: added `FollowerLink.waitUntilBound()` and made `bootFollower`
        await it before resolving `createSyncClientHandle`, so a follower is
        only handed back once it can receive fanned-out events. Regression
        tests added: a follower is bound-on-return (an immediately-emitted
        event reaches it) and a `waitUntilBound` unit (resolves on announce,
        rejects on bind timeout).
      - *Note (out of territory)*: `packages/typegen/test/golden-native.test.ts`
        shows a separate ~5-fail golden flake under load — a different class,
        left for the typegen agent.
- [x] **demo-react** (landed 2026-07-04 — `apps/demo-react`, port 8788): a
      single-pane hooks todo app on the SAME server as `apps/demo`,
      dogfooding `SyncProvider` + `useTypedQuery` (Kysely-typed) +
      `useMutation` + `useSyncStatus` + `useWindow` (a three-list filter
      dropdown driving `setWindow` — W1 windowing visible: switching lists
      bootstraps the new list and evicts the old). Worker + OPFS core, React
      via workspace deps, Bun.build serving (the demo pattern). Smoke test
      boots the server and asserts the React frontend builds (`/app.js`/
      `/worker.js`, `POST /sync` answers). Noted as create-app's third
      template candidate (not built). Verified live in-browser: typed reads,
      window switch, optimistic write + outbox drain all confirmed.

## 5. Release (gates with Benjamin)

- [ ] **6.3 Package naming** (Benjamin): pick final names; the rename is
      mechanical (one constants module in create-app; workspace-wide
      find/replace of @syncular-v2; publish ranges flip one constant).
- [ ] **Publishing pipeline**: changesets + trusted publishing for the v2
      package set, carrying the v1 lessons (binaryen/parse-check class
      guards: any pipeline that builds artifacts parse-validates them;
      post-publish install smokes with no platform skips).
- [ ] **6.4 Sunset actions** (Benjamin): promote v2/ toward repo root,
      archive old packages/ + rust/, execute the registry deprecations
      (incl. the broken-WASM 0.1.x artifacts), publish the migration
      guide (already written: docs/pages/migration.md).
- [ ] **7.1 Gate decision + 7.2 push** (Benjamin): the kill/merge call on
      the evidence in bench/RESULTS.md; the local commit stack ships when
      pushed.

## Ordering

Block 1 (native bindings) and Block 2 (deployment completion) are
parallel-friendly and independent. Block 3 (W1) should not start until
its react-oracle dependency (I3) has a consumer story — practically:
after Block 1's Tauri/RN bridges exist, since windowing's UX shows up in
apps. Block 4 rides whenever. Block 5 is Benjamin-gated and can happen at
any point — naming earlier is cheaper (fewer docs to re-grep).
