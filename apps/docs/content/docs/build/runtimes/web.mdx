# Web

For web apps, Syncular runs fully client-side: your UI reads and writes to **local SQLite**, then sync runs in the background.

For browser-hosted server APIs (no remote backend), see [Service Worker Server](/docs/build/service-worker-server).

## Recommended dialects

Pick one of these:

- **`@syncular/dialect-wa-sqlite`**: default recommendation for most web apps
- **`@syncular/dialect-pglite`**: if you specifically want Postgres compatibility locally

## Minimal setup (wa-sqlite)

```ts
import { createDatabase } from '@syncular/core';
import { createWaSqliteDialect } from '@syncular/dialect-wa-sqlite';
import { ensureClientSyncSchema } from '@syncular/client';

const db = createDatabase({
  dialect: createWaSqliteDialect({ fileName: 'app.db' }),
  family: 'sqlite',
});
await ensureClientSyncSchema(db);
```

Then wire it into your React provider (see [Client Setup](/docs/build/client-setup)).

## Persistence + storage notes

Browser storage has constraints (quota, eviction, cross-browser behavior). In practice:
- Keep the DB file name stable.
- Plan for “cold start” bootstrap to be resilient (snapshots + incremental pulls).
- Treat the local DB as the primary read/write path, but expect that users can clear site data.
