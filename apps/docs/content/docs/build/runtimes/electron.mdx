# Electron

Electron apps are a great fit for Syncular: you get a durable local SQLite database, instant UI reads/writes, and background sync.

## Recommended dialects

You typically choose between:

- **`@syncular/dialect-electron-sqlite` (recommended)**: renderer uses Kysely, SQL executes in the main process via a preload IPC bridge.
- **`@syncular/dialect-better-sqlite3`**: run SQLite directly in a Node-capable process.

The IPC approach is usually the cleanest because it keeps direct DB access out of the renderer and centralizes file/system access in main.

## Renderer setup (IPC dialect)

In the renderer:

```ts
import { createElectronSqliteDbFromWindow } from '@syncular/dialect-electron-sqlite';

// Uses window.electronAPI.sqlite by default (bridgeKey: "sqlite")
const db = createElectronSqliteDbFromWindow();
```

You’ll also need to implement the preload/main bridge that actually executes SQL and stores the DB on disk. The exact bridge is app-specific, but the mental model stays simple: renderer calls Kysely, main executes queries.
