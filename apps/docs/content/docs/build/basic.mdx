# Basic Setup

This page is intentionally short. The canonical, up-to-date setup lives in:

- [Quick Start](/docs/introduction/quick-start)
- [Server Setup](/docs/build/server-setup)
- [Client Setup](/docs/build/client-setup)

## One important convention (URLs)

Syncular’s OpenAPI paths are rooted at `/sync` and `/console/*`. A clean way to use that is:

- Choose an API base prefix (example: `/api`)
- Mount Sync routes at `${API_BASE}/sync`
- Create the client HTTP transport with `baseUrl: API_BASE`

That makes requests land at:

- `POST ${API_BASE}/sync` (with `push` and/or `pull` in the body)
- `GET  ${API_BASE}/sync/realtime` (WebSocket wake-ups)
