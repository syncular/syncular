# Testing in the Build Flow

Use this page for strategy. Use the dedicated [Testing](/docs/testing) section for concrete `@syncular/testkit` APIs and examples.

## Recommended test layers

1. Fast in-process tests for handler logic and conflict behavior.
2. Real HTTP integration tests for auth headers, routes, and subscriptions.
3. Runtime tests (node/deno/cloudflare) for environment-specific behavior.

## What to verify before production

- Scope filtering and authorization behavior.
- Conflict detection and resolution paths.
- Offline queueing and retry semantics.
- Bootstrap + incremental pull correctness.
- Realtime wake-up behavior (if enabled).
