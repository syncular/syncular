# API Reference

The Syncular server exposes HTTP endpoints for synchronization and optional console/ops endpoints.

All paths below are shown as they appear in the OpenAPI docs (i.e. mounted at `/sync` and `/console/*`).

## Base Endpoints

### Sync Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/sync` | Combined sync (`push` and/or `pull`) |
| `GET` | `/sync/audit/commits` | List commit audit history (auth/partition scoped) |
| `GET` | `/sync/audit/commits/{commitSeq}` | Get one commit with operation-level changes |
| `GET` | `/sync/realtime` | WebSocket "wake-up" connection (not part of OpenAPI) |
| `GET` | `/sync/snapshot-chunks/{chunkId}` | Download snapshot chunks for large bootstraps |
| `POST` | `/sync/blobs/upload` | Initiate a blob upload (optional feature) |
| `POST` | `/sync/blobs/{hash}/complete` | Mark a blob upload complete |
| `GET` | `/sync/blobs/{hash}/url` | Get a signed download URL for a blob |

### Console Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/console/stats` | Get server stats |
| `GET` | `/console/commits` | Browse commit history |
| `GET` | `/console/clients` | List connected clients |
| `GET` | `/console/handlers` | List table handlers |
| `GET` | `/console/storage` | List storage/blob objects (optional, requires `console.blobBucket`) |
| `GET` | `/console/storage/{key}/download` | Download a storage/blob object (optional) |
| `DELETE` | `/console/storage/{key}` | Delete a storage/blob object (optional) |

## Authentication

Syncular does not prescribe an authentication mechanism. The server calls your `authenticate()` function and uses whatever you decide (Bearer tokens, cookies, session headers, etc).

Typical Bearer token auth looks like:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Request/Response Format

All endpoints use JSON for request and response bodies:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

## OpenAPI Specification

The repo includes a generated OpenAPI spec:

- **Source**: `packages/server-hono/openapi.json`

If you want to serve it at runtime, mount the handler:

```ts
import { createOpenAPIHandler } from '@syncular/server-hono';

app.get('/openapi.json', createOpenAPIHandler(app, { title: 'Syncular API' }));
```

### Regenerating OpenAPI

To regenerate the OpenAPI specification:

```bash
bun generate:openapi
```

This will update the `openapi.json` file based on the current route definitions.
