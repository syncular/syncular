# Stream Investigation

Stream is the primary forensics view. It merges commits and request events into one timeline and supports deep drill-down.

## Timeline modes

- **All**: commits and events together.
- **Commits**: commit-only sequence for ordering checks.
- **Events**: push/pull request behavior only.

## Gateway and federated IDs

In gateway mode, Stream merges records from multiple instances.

- Each row includes a source instance label.
- Detail routes use federated IDs (`<instanceId>:<localId>`) to avoid cross-instance collisions.
- Use instance filters when you want local IDs and strict single-instance context.

## Search tokens

Use tokenized filters in the search box:

- `actor:<id>`
- `client:<id>`
- `table:<table_name>`
- `request:<request_id>`
- `trace:<trace_id>`

Free text still works and combines with token filters.

## Event detail

Event detail includes:

- sync path and transport path
- status/outcome/duration
- request and trace correlation IDs
- linked commit sequence
- payload reference and payload snapshot (when retained)

Use **Open linked commit** to pivot directly to commit detail.

## Commit detail

Commit detail includes:

- actor/client metadata
- affected tables
- per-change row IDs, operations, versions, and row JSON

Use this when you need an exact ordered view of what changed.

## Payload and trace drill-in

- Payload snapshots are available through `GET /console/events/:id/payload`.
- External trace links can be configured via `VITE_CONSOLE_TRACE_URL_TEMPLATE` in the Console app.
