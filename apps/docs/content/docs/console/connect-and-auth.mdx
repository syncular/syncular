# Connect and Auth

The Console connects to your Syncular server base URL and calls `/console/*` APIs with bearer-token authentication.

## Server URL

Set the server URL to the same base you use for sync transport.

- If sync is mounted at `/api/sync` and console at `/api/console`, use `https://your-host/api`.
- In the local demo, the URL is typically `http://localhost:9811/api`.

## Token

The Console sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on API requests.

Configure the token server-side through `createSyncServer({ console: { token } })` and distribute it only to authorized operators.

## Gateway mode

When the Console points at a gateway (`createConsoleGatewayRoutes`), it still authenticates with a single bearer token.

- The gateway forwards that token to each configured downstream instance by default.
- Downstream overrides are optional (`instances[].token`) when one target needs a different credential.
- The top-nav instance selector maps to gateway filters (`instanceId` / `instanceIds`) so operators can switch between merged and single-instance views.

## Prefill from query params

You can prefill connection settings using URL params:

- `server`: server base URL
- `token`: console token

Example:

```text
/console/?server=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9811%2Fapi&token=demo-token
```

## Partition context

The top navigation partition input scopes list/detail queries to one partition.

- Empty value means all partitions.
- Set a partition when investigating tenant-specific issues.

## Connection lifecycle

`Save + Connect` persists settings and validates the backend before marking the Console connected.

If the Console is disconnected but config is already saved, use `Connect` from the fallback screen.
