# Config and API Keys

The Config view is split into connection settings, API key lifecycle controls, and local UI preferences.

## Connection settings

- server URL
- console token
- `Save + Connect`, `Test Connection`, `Disconnect`

Use `Disconnect` with credential clearing when rotating operators or changing environments.

## API key lifecycle

Supported key operations:

- create key (`relay`, `proxy`, `admin`)
- set expiration (`expiresInDays`)
- filter by type/status/expiring window
- bulk revoke selected keys
- staged rotate (`rotate/stage`) followed by old-key revocation

Track key health through created/last-used/expiry/status columns.

Gateway note:

- In gateway mode, API key operations apply to exactly one selected instance.
- Select a single instance before listing, creating, rotating, or revoking keys.

## Preferences

Operator-level UI preferences include:

- refresh interval
- page size
- time format
- sparkline visibility

These are local browser preferences and do not affect server behavior.
