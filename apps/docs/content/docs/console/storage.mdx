# Storage

Storage is the blob/object inspection view in Console.

Use it to:

- list stored blob objects
- filter by key prefix
- download an object
- delete an object

## Availability

Storage endpoints are only available when your backend enables `console.blobBucket`.

If `blobBucket` is not configured, the Storage view cannot load `/console/storage`.

## Configure `blobBucket`

```ts
import { createSyncServer } from '@syncular/server-hono';

const { syncRoutes, consoleRoutes } = createSyncServer({
  db,
  dialect,
  handlers,
  authenticate,
  console: {
    token: process.env.SYNC_CONSOLE_TOKEN,
    blobBucket: {
      list: async ({ prefix, cursor, limit }) => myBucket.list({ prefix, cursor, limit }),
      get: async (key) => myBucket.get(key),
      delete: async (key) => myBucket.delete(key),
      head: async (key) => myBucket.head(key),
    },
  },
});
```

`blobBucket` is intentionally adapter-agnostic. You can map it to R2/S3 wrappers or your own object storage abstraction.

## Workflow

1. Open **Storage** from the Console top nav.
2. Enter a prefix (optional) to narrow the key set.
3. Use **Download** to fetch a local copy of the selected object.
4. Use **Delete** to remove a key (with confirmation).

## API endpoints used by the view

- `GET /console/storage`
- `GET /console/storage/:key/download`
- `DELETE /console/storage/:key`

All endpoints require console bearer auth, same as the rest of Console.
