# Troubleshooting

## Console cannot connect

Checks:

1. Verify server URL points to the sync base path (for example `.../api`).
2. Verify token matches server-side console token.
3. Confirm `/console/stats` returns `200` with bearer auth.
4. Check CORS policy if Console and API are on different origins.

## Connected, but no data appears

Checks:

1. Confirm correct partition context (empty means all partitions).
2. Expand time range in Stream filters.
3. Verify server has request-event rows and commits in selected partition.
4. Confirm token has access in the target environment.

## Gateway mode issues

### "No instances selected" or "instance required"

Checks:

1. Verify top-nav instance selector is set as intended.
2. For write actions (prune/compact/notify/evict/API key ops), select exactly one instance.
3. For merged reads, clear instance selector or use `instanceIds` as needed.

### One instance appears stale while others update

Checks:

1. Call `/console/instances/health` with your operator token.
2. Review `healthy`, `status`, and `reason` fields for failing downstream instances.
3. Confirm gateway can reach each configured `baseUrl` and that token forwarding/overrides are valid.

## Stream detail shows no payload snapshot

Possible causes:

- payload retention disabled
- payload pruned by retention policy
- event type/path does not capture payload

Use event metadata (`payloadRef`, `requestId`, `traceId`) for fallback correlation.

## Live feed appears stale

Checks:

1. Confirm Console live WebSocket is connected.
2. Trigger a known test mutation and verify new event arrival.
3. If needed, refresh to force timeline refetch.

## Evict does not solve client issue

Checks:

1. Confirm evict operation succeeded in audit log.
2. Verify client reconnected and bootstrap pull executed.
3. If external writes are involved, run `Notify Data Change`.
4. Inspect server/client logs for recurring auth or schema errors.
