# Fleet

Fleet is the client-centric operational view. Use it to identify which clients are behind, stale, or disconnected.

## Key concepts

- **Head**: latest commit sequence on the server.
- **Cursor**: last commit sequence acknowledged by a client.
- **Lag**: `head - cursor` for each client.
- **Activity state**: online, syncing, or stale/offline.

## What to check

1. **Max lag** trend over time.
2. **Which clients are behind** and by how much.
3. **Connection mode** (`realtime` vs `polling`) and path (`direct` vs `relay`).
4. **Effective scopes** for clients that appear missing data.

## Evicting a client

Use **Evict** when a client has irrecoverable cursor/state issues.

Effect:

- deletes that client cursor record
- forces bootstrap on next sync cycle
- creates an operation-audit entry

Use partition filters before eviction in multi-tenant setups.
