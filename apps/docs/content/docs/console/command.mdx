# Command

Command is the high-level operational dashboard. Use it to answer: "Are we healthy?" and "Where should I drill in next?"

## What to watch first

1. **Error Rate**: first indicator of active failures.
2. **Pending**: commit backlog against active client cursors.
3. **Active Clients**: sudden drops usually indicate auth or connectivity regressions.
4. **Recent Commits**: sanity-check actor/table patterns.

## Panels and data sources

- **Sync Topology**: client activity state and connection mode.
- **KPI Strip**: range-scoped metrics (`ops`, latency, error rate, client counts).
- **Activity / Latency charts**: push/pull volume and percentile trends.
- **Recent Commits table**: latest commit summaries with actor/table context.
- **Live Feed**: realtime event stream from console live WebSocket.

## Multi-instance gateway behavior

When connected through a console gateway, Command shows a merged view across selected instances.

- Use the top-nav instance selector to scope metrics and tables to one instance.
- Leave instance empty to view merged totals and timelines.
- In merged mode, partial downstream failures surface as degraded/partial responses rather than full dashboard failure.

## Investigation pivot points

- Go to **Stream** when you need event-level detail or payloads.
- Go to **Fleet** when lag/backlog appears client-specific.
- Go to **Ops** when external writes or compaction/pruning actions are needed.
- Go to **Storage** when troubleshooting blob/object availability.
