# Operations

The Ops view contains maintenance controls and an operation audit trail.

## Actions

### Prune

- **Preview Prune** first to inspect delete scope.
- **Prune** removes commits below the calculated watermark while honoring active-client protections.

### Compact

- Compacts change history according to compaction policy.
- Reduces storage pressure while preserving current row state.

### Notify Data Change

Use after out-of-band writes/imports performed outside normal push flow.

- Creates a synthetic commit.
- Invalidates cached snapshot chunks for affected tables.
- Triggers clients to re-bootstrap affected data.

## Safe operation order

1. Confirm issue and partition scope in Command/Fleet.
2. Use `Notify Data Change` for external writes.
3. Use `Prune Preview` before pruning.
4. Run prune/compact during low-traffic windows when possible.
5. Verify results in Operation Audit and Stream timeline.

## Gateway safety rules

In gateway mode, maintenance and config mutations are intentionally single-instance.

- Select one instance in the top-nav selector before running prune, compact, notify, or evict.
- If no instance (or multiple) is selected, write operations are rejected with an instance-required validation error.
- Use `GET /console/instances/health` to verify downstream reachability before running actions during incidents.

## Audit trail

Every action is logged with:

- operation type
- actor
- partition target
- result summary
