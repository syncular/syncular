# Incident Playbooks

Use these playbooks as deterministic response flows. Start broad in Command, narrow in Stream/Fleet, then execute actions in Ops.

## 1) "Row missing on one client"

1. In **Fleet**, locate the affected client and inspect lag/activity state.
2. In **Stream**, filter by `table:` and `client:` to confirm related commits/events.
3. Open linked commit/event details to verify scope and payload content.
4. If client cursor/state is inconsistent, evict that client.
5. If data changed out-of-band, run `Notify Data Change` for affected table(s).

## 2) "Backlog growing, clients falling behind"

1. In **Command**, confirm Pending and latency trends.
2. In **Fleet**, identify specific lagging clients and connection modes.
3. Validate network/availability first; avoid destructive actions before stabilization.
4. Use `Prune Preview` only after active lag normalizes.

## 3) "External import completed but clients still stale"

1. Confirm external writes bypassed normal push flow.
2. Run `Notify Data Change` with exact table list and partition.
3. Verify synthetic commit in Stream/Command.
4. Confirm client cursors advance in Fleet.

## 4) "Repeated push errors"

1. In **Stream**, switch to Events and filter `outcome:error`.
2. Open event details, inspect `errorCode`, `status`, request payload snapshot.
3. Group failures by actor/client/table to detect pattern scope.
4. Apply server fix, then monitor error-rate drop and successful pushes.

## Post-incident checklist

1. Export relevant timeline rows and commit/event IDs.
2. Capture operation-audit entries for maintenance actions taken.
3. Record partition, actor/client IDs, and exact action timestamps.
4. Add a regression test where feasible (API route or UI flow).
