# Syncular vs PowerSync

[PowerSync](https://powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps. Client SDKs are open-source, and the PowerSync Service source is available under the Functional Source License (and later becomes Apache 2.0).

> **Last verified:** February 2026. PowerSync is actively evolving — check their docs for the latest.

## Methodology

This comparison focuses on:

- How you express “what data belongs on a device” (**Syncular scopes** vs **PowerSync sync rules**)
- Licensing/hosting differences (fully OSS vs source-available service + managed option)
- Conflict semantics defaults (and where you customize them)

## The trade-off

| | Syncular | PowerSync |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **Licensing** | MIT (fully open) | SDKs Apache 2.0; service source-available |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted | Self-hosted (Open Edition) or managed |
| **Source code** | Fully open | Client open, server source-available |
| **Pricing** | Free | Free (Open Edition), usage-based (managed) |
| **Auth model** | JSONB scopes | Sync rules (YAML) |
| **Supported DBs** | Postgres | Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL (beta), SQL Server (alpha) |
| **Mobile support** | React Native | Flutter, React Native, Swift, Kotlin |
| **Conflict semantics** | App-defined | Default LWW per-field; configurable |

## What PowerSync does well

**Multiple databases**: Supports Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL (beta), and SQL Server (alpha).

**Strong mobile SDKs**: First-class Flutter, React Native, Swift, and Kotlin SDKs.

**Sync rules**: Declarative sync rules in YAML:

```yaml
sync_rules:
  - table: tasks
    filter: user_id = :user_id OR project_id IN (
      SELECT project_id FROM project_members WHERE user_id = :user_id
    )
```

**Professional support**: Team and Enterprise plans include SLA-backed support.

**Open Edition**: Self-host the PowerSync Service for free (source-available, not OSI-approved open source).

## Where PowerSync has limits

**Server licensing**: The PowerSync Service Open Edition is source-available, not fully open source. Enterprise features require a paid license.

**Complex sync rules**: Sync rules are powerful but can become complex for hierarchical permissions.

**Cost at scale**: Managed service pricing scales with usage (data synced, connections).

## Where Syncular differs

**Fully open source**: Everything is MIT-licensed. No distinction between client and server.

**No per-user fees**: Run on your infrastructure with no usage-based costs.

**Scopes for auth**: Programmatic scope resolution in TypeScript:

```typescript
async resolveScopes(ctx) {
  const memberships = await ctx.db
    .selectFrom('project_members')
    .select('project_id')
    .where('user_id', '=', ctx.actorId)
    .execute();

  return {
    user_id: [ctx.actorId],
    project_id: memberships.map(m => m.project_id),
  };
}
```

**Type safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Kysely.

## Auth model comparison

### PowerSync (Sync Rules)

```yaml
sync_rules:
  - table: tasks
    filter: user_id = :user_id
```

- **Pros**: Declarative, simple for basic cases
- **Cons**: Limited expressiveness, SQL-only logic

### Syncular (Scopes)

```typescript
async resolveScopes(ctx) {
  // Any TypeScript logic
  const memberships = await ctx.db
    .selectFrom('project_members')
    .where('user_id', '=', ctx.actorId)
    .execute();

  return {
    user_id: [ctx.actorId],
    project_id: memberships.map(m => m.project_id),
  };
}
```

- **Pros**: Fully programmable, composable
- **Cons**: More code to write

## When to choose PowerSync

- You need support for MongoDB or SQL Server
- Mobile (especially Flutter) is your primary platform
- You want professional support and SLA guarantees
- Sync rules are sufficient for your auth model

## When to choose Syncular

- You want fully MIT-licensed code
- Cost control is important (no usage fees)
- You need flexible, programmatic authorization
- You're already using Kysely

## Summary

| Choose PowerSync if... | Choose Syncular if... |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| You need MongoDB/SQL Server support | Postgres-only is fine |
| Mobile Flutter is primary | Web/React Native focus |
| Professional support/SLA needed | Community support sufficient |
| Source-available server is acceptable | Fully MIT-licensed required |
