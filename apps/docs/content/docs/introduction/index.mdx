# Introduction

Syncular is a sync framework for building **local-first applications** — apps that store data locally, work offline, and sync transparently when online.

> **Alpha.** APIs, wire formats, and storage layouts will change between releases. Pin versions and expect manual migrations between versions.

> **You are here:** Introduction and core concepts.
>
> **If you're implementing Syncular:** start with [Build](/docs/build) (canonical build path).
