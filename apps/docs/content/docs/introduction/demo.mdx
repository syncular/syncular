description: Run the current Syncular demo (Service Worker server + built-in Console) and explore key workflows.
---

# Try the Demo

The demo app runs the full Syncular stack in-browser:

- React app shell
- Sync + console APIs served by a Service Worker server
- Local SQLite persistence (wa-sqlite) plus a PGlite client variant
- Built-in Console UI at `/console`

This is intentionally close to a real deployment flow, but with no external backend dependency.

## Run it

```bash
bun install
bun --cwd apps/demo dev
```

By default, the demo prints a local URL such as:

- app: `http://localhost:9811/`
- console: `http://localhost:9811/console`

## Important runtime behavior

- Service Worker mode is required for API handling in this demo.
- `/api/*` is handled by the Service Worker server.
- The network dev server intentionally does not serve live `/api/*` sync endpoints.

If Service Worker registration or health check fails, the app renders an explicit startup error screen instead of silently falling back.

## Demo tabs

## 1) Split Screen

Two independent clients sync against the same server state:

- left panel: wa-sqlite
- right panel: PGlite

Try:

1. Create/update tasks on one side and verify propagation to the other.
2. Toggle sync controls to queue writes, then resume and observe replay.
3. Make conflicting edits to inspect conflict handling behavior.

## 2) Media Sync

Covers blob-aware workflows (upload/download + metadata references in synced rows).

Try:

1. Upload media in one panel.
2. Verify sync metadata propagation and retrieval behavior on the other panel.

## 3) Large Catalog

Exercises large bootstrap and chunked snapshot behavior.

Try:

1. Seed a large dataset.
2. Observe bootstrap paging/chunk behavior.
3. Filter/query locally after bootstrap completes.

## 4) E2EE Key Share

Demonstrates field-level encryption plus mnemonic-based key exchange.

Try:

1. Write encrypted data as owner.
2. Observe ciphertext on peer before key share.
3. Share mnemonic and verify peer decryption.

## 5) Symmetric E2EE

Demonstrates a shared-key encrypted flow from the start.

## Built-in Console (`/console`)

The demo includes Console in the same app shell so you can move between app and operator views quickly.

Console views:

- **Command**: high-level health + KPIs
- **Stream**: timeline for commits/events/payload drill-down
- **Fleet**: client cursor/lag and eviction workflows
- **Ops**: prune/compact/notify data change + audit trail
- **Storage**: blob/object view (available when storage routes are enabled)
- **Config**: endpoint/auth/preferences and API key controls
